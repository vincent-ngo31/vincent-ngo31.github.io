    "bio": "Hi! I'm Vincent, a San Diego native, a spicy food obsessive, and an avid curator of sad music playlists. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a double major in Data Science and Cognitive Science, and I'm hoping to apply that knowledge to a Software Engineering role in the near future. I'm constantly looking for ways to improve myself, and I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty to prove it. I perform best when I'm surrounded with ambitious, like-minded people who are just as passionate about their work as I am. When I'm not working on my next project, I'm probably enjoying an oolong milk tea or discovering underrated artists on Spotify. Please feel free to check out some of my past projects below.",
